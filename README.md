# AI-Assisted Code Analysis & Refactoring

This repository documents my exploration of AI-assisted systems
for understanding and refactoring legacy backend codebases.

## Motivation
Large production systems are costly to refactor and error-prone.
This project explores how large language models can assist while
analyzing failure modes, hallucinations, and correctness risks.

## Implementation
Active development and experiments are hosted on GitLab:
➡️ https://gitlab.com/dgifted

This repository serves as a public research index and experiment log.

## Research Questions
- When do LLMs produce unsafe refactoring suggestions?
- How can human-in-the-loop verification improve reliability?
